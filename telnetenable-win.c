/*
  This program is a re-implementation of the telnet console enabler utility
  for use with Netgear wireless routers.

  The original Netgear Windows binary version of this tool is available here:
  http://www.netgear.co.kr/Support/Product/FileInfo.asp?IDXNo=155

  Per DMCA 17 U.S.C. ยง1201(f)(1)-(2), the original Netgear executable was
  reverse engineered to enable interoperability with other operating systems
  not supported by the original windows-only tool (MacOS, Linux, etc).
